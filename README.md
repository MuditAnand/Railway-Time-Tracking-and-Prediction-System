## Getting Started using Git on Github

Assumption: a project called `repo` already exists on the machine, and a new branch has been pushed to GitHub.com since the last time changes were made locally

## Pushing updates remotely into GitHub using Git

change into the `repo` directory
`cd repo`

change into the existing branch called `feature-a`
`git checkout feature-a`

make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` using the text editor

stage the changed file
`git add file1.md`

take a snapshot of the staging area
`git commit -m "edit file1"`

push changes to github
`git push`
